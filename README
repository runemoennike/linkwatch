LinkWatch

Crawls threads on one or more forum sites and add any new links to JDownloader using JD Remote Control

Features:
	- Login on forum sites (or other sites for that matter).
	- Crawl threads (or other pages) and extract URLs.
	- Ability to filter URLs added based on hostname.
	- Add extracted links for download in JDownloader
	- Remember links so they aren't added on next crawl again.
	- Very simple management interface to manage stuff.
	- Uses flat files, no database required.

Requirements:
	- JDownloader with JD Remote Control enabled (v. 9568)
	- PHP (mysql not required) for the crawler (CLI or browser)
	- Apache or other server (with PHP installed and configured) to access management interface
	
Setup:
	- install.php should be run first (will be autorun if you navigate in browser to project root url)
	- Change the $CONFIG['jdremote'] line in includes/config.inc if your JD Remote Control is not accessible on localhost:10025.
	
Usage:
	- crawl.php crawls the sites/threads. Run from command line/schedular with "php -f crawl.php", must be run from project root folder.
	- manage.php is the management interface, use it to add sites, threads, and accepted hosts (for links). Also shows some basic stats.

Notes:
Not my responsibity what kind of links and sites you crawl/add to JD using these scripts. I simply made it for the technical challenge.
